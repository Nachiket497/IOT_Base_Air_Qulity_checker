# IOT-based-air-quality-checker-by-MQ135

Air Pollution is increasing heavily these days due to the many important factors like Vehicle Emissions, Deforestation, Industrialization. Old vehicles could produce more smoke and hence those vehicles could be banned from using. But we need a proper metric that tells us whats the intensity level of air pollution, whether it is low, medium or high. So, we can take help of various sensors that could detect the air quality and from the corresponding values, we do mathematical calculations and from that results, we could fix the threshold value from which we can say whether the desired air quality is below the threshold value or not. 
    
Air pollution sensors are devices that can detect the presence of air 
pollution in the surroundings, as the name suggests. The detection is in terms of a 
ppm value of the pollutants the sensor can detect, and then those ppm values can 
be used to monitor the environment, based on standard safety values.

So we done one project and that's our project video link.
